# About Me

 I am an PhD student/researcher in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison. I work within the [Precision Mechatronics and Control Lab](https://pmcl.me.wisc.edu/), where my focus lies in researching magnetically leviatated axial flux machines. In the past, my experience with the [Severson Group](https://elev.umn.edu/home) and [WEMPEC](https://wempec.wisc.edu/) has allowed me to build a strong background in electric machine prototyping and fabrication.

 When I'm not in the research lab, busy prototyping or coding Python scripts, you'll often find me indulging in my other passions such as photographies, LEGOs, movies, hiking, and Formula 1 racing, which offer a much-needed escape from the academic world. At home, I would also spend a lot of time with my feline friend, [Tofu](../images/tofu_cat/tofu2.jpg) :smile_cat:.
