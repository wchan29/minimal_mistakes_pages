# Overview
This is an ongoing project for the Department of Energy to research and develope design plans for higher efficiencies in Combined Heat and Power (CHP) generation technology. A specially designed housing was prototyped for an optimized bearingless generator using additive manufacturing technology with AlSi10Mg alloy. Active cooling channels are incorporated into the design to increase stator current and power density.

Special thanks to [Owen Coulson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/owen-coulson-88393a205/) for working on creating the CAD model.

# Current Responsibility
- Develop and fabricate additively manufactured housing with integrated cooling channels for a 100kW, 80kRPM high-speed twin bearingless generator in a microturbine-based CHP generation system.
- Fabricate stators and other components necessary to assembly the bearingless generator.

# Pictures
Some fun work pictures during the assembly of the bearingless generator.
