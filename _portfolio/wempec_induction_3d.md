This is a design summary for a mechanical engineering senior design project aimed at creating a compact, low-voltage induction machine building kit for future use in electrical engineering courses at UW-Madison. This kit was requested by the Grainger Teaching Studio to be designed and prototyped for a new, hands-on power conversion course being offered at the university. The design summary will go through the progression and the several iterations the team created for this project.

# Background 
As highlighted in the earlier overview section, the core objective of this project was to develop an induction motor building kit for an upcoming electrical engineering course. This course aims to challenge students in optimizing various machine parameters, encompassing factors such as pole count, winding turns, and targeted torque. Our intention is to supply the Grainger Teaching Studio with a budget-friendly prototype that would be served as a base model that student could improve/modified upon.

Ultimately, the kit we designed would not only enrich the educational experience of students in this advanced course but also equip them with a hands-on experience in building motor as they transition into the industry.

# So, what is an induction machine?
Induction machines, also known as asynchronous machines, are one of the most widely used electrical motors in both domestic and industrial applications. About 50 percent of global power is consumed by electric machines, and over 90 percent of industrial machines are induction motors [2]. One of the main reasons it is so widely used is due to its high efficiency, which can achieve as high as 97 percent [3]. The high efficiency combined with low maintenance and self- starting properties makes the induction machine one of the most popular choices within the industry.

An induction machine comprises of two main components, the stationary stator and a rotating rotor. An exploded view of a common industrial squirrel cage type induction machine is shown in figure below. The main frame, typically made from cast iron, is used to house and protect the stator and rotor from damage as well as protect the user while operating. While sometimes not necessary, fans are added to the machine to prevent the stator coils from overheating.  

[<img src="/images/portfolio/wempec_induction_3d/induction_machine_cross_sect.JPG" width="1000" >](/images/portfolio/wempec_induction_3d/induction_machine_cross_sect.JPG)

A cross-sectional view of the stator is shown below and is derived from a design software. The stator of an induction machine is typically composed of stator windings and iron laminations. The copper windings in the stator of an AC machines are typically wound in a distributed fashion, meaning they are typically spread throughout the stator lamination [4]. Since an induction machine typically has three phases, the windings would have three individual input terminals. When the three-phase windings in the stator are connected to a three-phase power source, a rotating magnetic field is generated as the electromagnets interact. This rotating magnetic field induces a current in the rotor and generates torque in the rotor, creating a rotating motion.

[]()

The squirrel cage rotor design uses conducting bars (typically made from copper and/or aluminum) connected to a shorting ring on either end [4]. Within the cage, iron laminations are added to assist the flow of magnetic flux generated by the stator windings. A current is induced in the rotor bars when a rotating magnetic field is generated by the stator windings. The interactions between the induced current in the rotor and the rotating magnetic field in the stator allows the generation of torque in the squirrel cage rotor, causing a rotational motion. As seen above, the bars are skewed at an angle. This is to prevent cogging, which is a locking of the rotor upon startup that commonly occurs when there is an equal number of conductor bars and stator teeth. Despite eliminating this, the motor may experience cogging in the form of running rough. The skew can help mitigate these adverse effects if properly implemented. For the scope of this project, skewing is ranked as a “nice to have” feature in later iterations but will not be included in the initial prototype.

# Brainstorming
Since the kit we were designing was intended for students who will be participating in a semester-long electrical engineering course, the client has placed a strong emphasis on prioritizing manufacturability over performance. This is due to the limited time the students will have during the semester to assemble the kit. Additionally, the budget for each motor kit is firmly capped at **$100**. Together, these factors highlight the significance of manufacturability and cost-effectiveness in this project.

Beyond the considerations of manufacturability and cost, a set of constraints were also provided to us for the prototype we would be building. The constraints were, 

1.  The maximum stator cross-sectional dimension must be **100 mm x 100 mm** only
2.  The voltage rating of the prototype should be capped at **15V or lower**.
3.  The copper slot fill factor of the prototype should be **above 30%**

In addition to the specific asks from the client, for the prototype we also had to consider target values. 

1. Rated Power
2. Operating electrical frequency (directly affects mechanical speed)
3. Number of squrrial cage bars 
4. Number of poles
5. Single or Double-Layer winding

The team believes that since the main focus of the project is on manufacturability rather than optimizing the machine's performance, the rated power becomes a less critical factor in shaping the machine's design. As a result, we settled on a rated power output of 100W, indicating that the prototype would be a low power machine. Alongside this decision, the team opted for a 4-pole design for the pole count, a choice often regarded as the industry standard. Another important consideration was the rated speed. Our client informed us that the 3-phase motor drive in the Grainger Design Lab has a range of electrical frequencies between 50Hz and 60Hz, which implies that with a 4-pole design, the options are either 1700 RPM or 1800 RPM. After careful deliberation, the team selected a rated speed of 1800 RPM.

With these in mind, the manufacturability and cost were the priorities for this project, where manufacturability includes the ability to build using in-house tools and machines, ease of assembly, and repeatability/robustness of the design and process. 


# Design
As mentioned in the previous overview, we extensively utilized tools like JMAG Express in our design process. JMAG Express serves as a parameter-based motor design support tool, allowing users to input values such as size, input voltage, stack length, etc., and receive estimated machine characteristic results. This tool played a pivotal role in shaping our design process for the first prototype, providing essential insights and estimations.

[<img src="/images/portfolio/wempec_induction_3d/jmag_design_process.png" width="1000" >](/images/portfolio/wempec_induction_3d/jmag_design_process.png)

The team investigated existing induction motor building kits in the market; however, these kits are not very prevalent, and those found were either costly and included a higher percentage of pre-fabricated parts, decreasing student’s learning potential.

Extensive research on induction machine designs was conducted before initiating our own design process. Our team's initial prototype design was influenced by an existing brushed DC machine from the Grainger Innovation Lab. Utilizing tools like JMAG Express, we analyzed various configurations and estimated performance.

# Assembly 
This section will cover the assembly procsses of the three different prototypes we came up with for this project.

## First Iteration (P1)

The first task tackled was laser cutting the steel laminations for the stator and rotor. The video below provides a visual demonstration of the rotor laminations being cut using the FabLight 4500 laser cutter in the Grainger Power Electronics and Electric Machines Laboratory on campus. For context, the lamination steel we used was M19 29 gauge steel provided by the client.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RJTXT0NyHhg?si=eCmszX4WzRlmwYv8" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<br/>

After completing the lamination cutting process, the resulting rotor laminations were inserted and stacked onto the keyed shaft we purchased from McMaster.

[<img src="/images/portfolio/wempec_induction_3d/PB200573.JPG" width="800" >](/images/portfolio/wempec_induction_3d/PB200573.JPG)

The next task the team did was cutting the copper rotor bars in length. These bars were intended for insertion into the rotor laminations, with copper end rings to be soldered on both sides, effectively creating a short circuit across all the bars. However, during the attempt to insert the copper rotor bars into the laminations, the team encountered resistance in the process. Investigation revealed that the laminations had slight variations in their cuts, leading to a significant misalignment of the copper bar slots. This misalignment can be seen in the image below, and it is clearly visible on the outer surface of the rotor lamination.

[<img src="/images/portfolio/wempec_induction_3d/rotor_bar_misalignment.JPG" width="1000" >](/images/portfolio/wempec_induction_3d/rotor_bar_misalignment.JPG)

After some investigations, it was determined that the problem arose from the absence of tab features being enabled in the laser cutter's settings during the cutting of the rotor laminations. During the cutting process, nitrogen gas was blasted at the cut to prevent oxidation on the cut surfaces of the steel. Due to the combination of this blasting action and the absence of tab features, the laminations experienced slight shifts with each cut. Consequently, the cuts were inconsistent, resulting in the observed misalignment on the rotor laminations.

#### Figure obtained from [SendCutSend.com](https://sendcutsend.com/faq/what-are-tabs-how-can-they-be-removed/)
<br/>
After the team figured out the root cause of the failure, the team proceeded to re-cut the laminations with the correct tab settings. Futhermore, additional tolerancing was also allotted to the laminations to ensure the copper bars cut fit through all 43 lamination sheets. Immediate improvement was observed as the copper bars fit into the rotor.  

With the issue resolved, the team moved forward with the task of soldering the copper end rings to the rotor bars. Unfortunately, another issue emerged during this phase. With only a low-powered soldering machine avaliable to us, the soldering process took approximately 3 hours. This extended duration primarily stemmed from the larger thermal mass the soldering iron needed to heat up in order to attain the necessary temperature for proper solder melting. This is not optimal for a machine that is supposed to be easily assembled but will be considered as a potential area for improvement in future prototypes.

With the rotor done, time to move on to the stator. The resulting stator laminations were first stacked and secured together using four M6 fasteners. Following this step, insulation papers were inserted into the stator slots. These insulation papers play a critical role by ensuring electrical insulation, effectively preventing copper wires from coming into contact with the steel laminations and creating potential short circuits.

The next step was winding the copper coils. A manual hand coil winding machine located in the Grainger Prototype Lab was used in create these coils.

After about an hour or so, all stator windings were sucessfully installed. As can be seen in image below, there are total of six coils and are connected in wye configuration. Images below shows the fully wound stator with the rotor inserted.

## Second Iteration (P2)
Based on the feedback and lessons learned from building the first prototype, we came up with several improvements we hoped to achieve for our second iteration prototype.

1. Improve rotor assembly, specifically on the soldering part of the copper endplate.
2. Reduce overall assembly height, particularly the end-turns of the coils.
3. Come up with new method of preventing copper coils from getting into the airgap.
   
We made an attempt to utilize a 3D printed winding jig to shape the coils and reduce the length of their end-turns. The images below depict metal bars on the jig, which are aluminum standoffs.
