# 0. Overview

This is a design summary for a mechanical engineering senior design project aimed at creating a compact, low-voltage induction machine building kit for future use in electrical engineering courses at UW-Madison. This kit was requested by the Grainger Teaching Studio to be designed and prototyped for a new, hands-on power conversion course being offered at the university. The design summary will go through the progression and the several iterations the team created for this project.
