# Current Responsibility
- Facilitate the development of a multi-physics modeling framework for evaluating and optimizing BSPM electric
machines. Created Python scripts necessary to evaluate machine constants and coil inductances in JMAG.

- Performing setup and characterization of a 4-DOF 8kW twin stators BSPM machine. Prepared engineering drawings
and fabricated components for dynamometer fixturing.

- Experimentally validate BSPM FEA thermal models created in ANSYS Motor-CAD.
